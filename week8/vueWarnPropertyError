2. Property ... was accessed during render but is not defined on instance.  5 points

What does this Vue warning message mean?
To me, this error means the program accessed a value that Vue didn't.

Can you safely ignore it?
I don't think it can be safely ignored.

What causes it, and how do you fix it?
Having a value excluded from Vue's access. It can be fixed by making sure the
    const {createApp, ref, ect.} = Vue
are being used and returned.
